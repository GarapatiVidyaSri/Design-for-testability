# Design-for-testability
This repository contains verilog code for various faulty circuits to check their behaviour.
# Fault Abstraction
Faults are potential defects that engineers simulate using fault models to create test patterns. These
patterns help detect and address faulty circuits.
As defects occur in a circuit, their effects may be seen at various levels of abstraction. For
example, a physical defect of a short between an NMOS transistor gate and its source may be seen
at the switch, gate, RT, or system-level.
